      "In the last couple of decades, but increasingly so in the last few years, all scientific disciplines have been tossed into the deep end of the computational pool, often while not being too well prepared for the dip. Up until the end of the XX century, scientific computing was mostly the domain of physicists, chemists and engineers. Fortran and C dominated the scene, and for the most part scientific computing was synonymous with high-end numerical analysis. However, now, all disciplines are drowning in quantitative data and need to develop a culture of scientific computing. Fortunately, the revolution in open source (made possible by the opening of the Internet in the late 90\u2019s) has created many freely available tools, and a culture of how to use them and develop them, that is causing lasting changes in scientific computing.\n",

      "The backbone of scientific computing is mostly a collection of high-performance code written in Fortran, C and C++ that typically runs in batch mode on large systems, dclusters, and supercomputers.  However, over the past decade, high-level environments that integrate easy-to-use integrate easy-to-use interpreted languages, comprehensive numerical libraries, and visualization facilities have become faster, the critical bottleneck in scientific computing is not always the computer\u2019s processing time; the scientist\u2019s time is also a consideration.  For this reason, systems that allow rapid algorithmic exploration, data analysis, and visualization have become a staple of daily scientific work.  The Interactive Data language (IDL) and Matlab (for numerical work), and Mathematica and Maple (for work that includes symbolic manipulation) are well-known commercial environments of this kind.  GNU Data Language, Octave, Maxima and Sage provide their open source counterparts."

This flexible style matches well the spirit of computing in a scientific context, in which determining what computations must be performed next often requires significant work. An interactive environment lets scientists look at data, test new ideas, combine algorithmic approaches, and evaluate their outcome directly. This process might lead to a final result, or it might clarify how they need to build a more static, large-scale production code.  Overall, it can make a significant difference to how scientific research is conducted and disseminated.\n",
